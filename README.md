# **Encryption and Decryption System 🔒💻**

This project implements an encryption and decryption system using a combination of various techniques, including XOR cipher, Caesar cipher, and custom methods like adding random characters at the start/end of strings and reversing text. The system allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages with a randomly generated key and a sequence of encryption steps.

## **Features 🌟**

- **Multiple Encryption Techniques**: Includes XOR cipher, Caesar cipher, and custom methods for adding random characters, reversing text, and more. 🔑
- **Randomized Key Generation**: Encryption is performed using a randomly generated key for better security. 🔐
- **Encryption and Decryption Functions**: Encrypt and decrypt messages securely using the provided key. 🔄
- **Flexible and Extensible**: Easily extendable with more encryption methods. 🔧
  
## **Techniques Used 🛠️**
- **Caesar Cipher**: Shifts the characters in the string by a specified number. 🔠
- **XOR Cipher**: Uses a bitwise XOR operation with a randomly generated key. 🔲
- **Random Character Insertion**: Inserts random characters at the start or end of the string to obfuscate the plaintext. ✨
- **String Reversal**: Reverses the entire string for added complexity. 🔄
- **Random Word Insertion**: Adds random words in between original words. 📚
- **Word Repeats**: Repeats words multiple times within the text for obfuscation. 🔁
